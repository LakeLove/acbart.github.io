# Potential Projects

Are you an undergraduate interested in doing research with me? Here are some topics and areas that are interesting to me.

## Program Analysis in TIFA

The [TIFA](https://github.com/acbart/pedal/tree/master/pedal/tifa) module of [Pedal](https://github.com/acbart/pedal) performs abstract intrepretation of Python code in order to determine common issues and typecheck.

* Open Problems:
  * Currently does not have support for Object-oriented programming and more complicated ideas about namespaces
  * Currently does not have support for type annotations
* Preferred expertise:
  * Python programming experience
  * Program Analysis experience
  * Experience with Compilers and/or Parsing
* Necessary expertise:
  * Data Structures (e.g., CISC220)

## BlockMirror: Dual Block/Text Interface Component

Extract out the Block/Text interface from BlockPy into a component called BlockMirror.

* Open Problems:
  * **Beta version currently in development by 475 Team**
  * Figure out best possible block representations of Python code to support student learning
  * Support complete Python language and all syntactically valid Python code
  * Integrate ideas from TIFA to have proper types in Blocks
* Preferred expertise:
  * JavaScript and Python programming experience
  * HCI and User Experience Design
  * Experience with Parsing
  * Program Analysis experience (for some advanced ideas)
* Necessary expertise:
  * Data Structures (e.g., CISC220)

## Curriculum Packaging Format

How should instructors in Computing bundle up their lessons for sharing, evaluating, adopting, etc.?

* Open Problems:
  * Designing and developing initial formats
* Preferred expertise (or what you will learn from working with me):
  * Markdown
  * Instructional Design
* Necessary expertise:
  * Introductory programming (e.g., CISC108)

## Waltz: Canvas Management Tools

* Various tools for synchronizing a Canvas course with a Github repo
* Web interface to simplify comparisons and diff resolutions
* Interfaces for generating reports, managing TAs, and setting course options.


## Programming Typing Tutor Game

**On hold while we determine need**

* Students type code from real repositories
* Based on language-theories of learning to program
* Uses AST filtering to only provide code suitable to the student's current level
* [[HCI]] [[Program Analysis]] [[Web Applications]]
