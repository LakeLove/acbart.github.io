# Potential Projects

Are you an undergraduate interested in doing research with me? Here are some topics and areas that are interesting to me.

## Program Analysis in TIFA

The [TIFA](https://github.com/acbart/pedal/tree/master/pedal/tifa) module of [Pedal](https://github.com/acbart/pedal) performs abstract intrepretation of Python code in order to determine common issues and typecheck.

* Open Problems:
  * Currently does not have support for Object-oriented programming and more complicated ideas about namespaces
  * Currently does not have support for type annotations
  * We might need a JavaScript port that can be efficiently kept in sync
* You'll need to have...
  * Data Structures (e.g., CISC220)
* You'll get experience with...
  * Python programming experience
  * Program Analysis experience
  * Experience with Compilers and/or Parsing

## BlockMirror: Dual Block/Text Interface Component

Extract out the Block/Text interface from BlockPy into a component called BlockMirror.

* Open Problems:
  * Figure out best possible block representations of Python code to support student learning
  * Support complete Python language and all syntactically valid Python code
  * Integrate ideas from TIFA to have proper types in Blocks
* You'll need to have...
  * Data Structures (e.g., CISC220)
* You'll get experience with...
  * JavaScript and Python programming
  * HCI and User Experience Design
  * Parsing
  * Program Analysis

## Curriculum Packaging Format

How should instructors in Computing bundle up their lessons for sharing, evaluating, adopting, etc.?

* Open Problems:
  * Designing and developing formats for quizzes, programming assignments, projects, grading rubrics, course staff instructions, in-class lessons, etc.
  * Protocols for developing lessons, exams, evaluations, etc.
* You'll need to have...
  * Introductory programming (e.g., CISC108)
* You'll get experience with...
  * Markdown
  * Instructional Design

## Waltz: Canvas Management Tools

Various tools for synchronizing a Canvas course with a Github repo

* Open Problems:
  * Building a web interface to simplify comparisons and diff resolutions
  * Building interfaces for generating reports, managing TAs, and setting course options.

* You'll need to have...
  * Software Engineering (e.g., CISC275)
* You'll get experience with...
  * Web development
  * Version Control Systems (like Git)
  * Web APIs (Canvas, Git)
  * Usability Engineering
  * Educational theories related to Instructional Design
  
## Meta-cognition Interactive Tutor for Programming

Intelligent tutoring system for BlockPy (or other relevant system) that helps support metacognitive behaviors based on a model of students.

* Open problems:
  * How do we encourage students to write more tests as they debug problems?
  * How do we encourage students to decompose their solutions into multiple parts?
  * How do we encourage students to seek and interpret automated feedback?
  * How do we encourage students to work early, often, and for appropriate time lengths?
  * How do model students in order to determine optimal intervention times?
  * How do we intervene to make a measurable impact on student behavior?
  * What relationship do these metacognitive interventions have on student learning?
* You'll need to have...
  * Data Structures (e.g., CISC220)
* You'll get experience with...
  * AI techniques
  * Machine Learning
  * Web development
  * Educational Theories related to Meta Cognition
  
## Pedagogical Dataset Development

Build datasets that are meant for classrooms, drawing from extremely varied sources

* Open Problems:
  * Need a large number of new datasets from any area you can think of (Biology, Law, Literature, etc.)
  * Need to revise and improve a number of existing datasets
* You'll get experience with...
  * Data Science
  * Data Transformation
  * Web APIs
  * Python
  * User Experience Design

## Programming Typing Tutor Game

**On hold while we determine need**

An experimental game for improving students' ability to write syntacticaly correct code.

* Open Problems:
  * Initial version of web game
* You'll need to have...
  * Software Engineering (e.g., CISC275)
* You'll get experience with...
  * Web development
  * Educational Game Design
  * Parsing
